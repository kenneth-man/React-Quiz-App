# React Quiz App

A simple quiz app that displays 10 randomly chosen, non-repeating questions from an array of questions. Then a score is displayed in a results page, showing the number of questions answered correctly. The player can then play again, and another 10 random questions are chosen, with the score resetting to 0

Using react hooks useEffect, useState, useContext and routing from react router dom
